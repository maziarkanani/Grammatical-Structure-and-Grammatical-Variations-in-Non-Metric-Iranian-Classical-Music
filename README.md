# Grammatical-Structure-and-Grammatical-Variations-in-Non-Metric-Iranian-Classical-Music

We use our introduced algorithm for parsing melodic structure (Kanani et al., 2023). Unlike much Western music, this type of non-metric music does not follow bar-centric organisation. The non-metric organisation can be captured well by our parsing algorithm. We parse each tune (Gusheh) into a grammar to identify motifs and phrases, and evaluate the grammars to demonstrate the algorithm’s effectiveness. These grammar representations can be useful for educational and ethnomusicological purposes.

We also further develop a previously-introduced method of creating melodic variations (Kanani et al., 2023). After parsing an existing tune to produce a grammar, by applying mutations to this grammar, we generate a new grammar. Expanding this new version yields a variation of the original tune. Variations are assessed by a domain-expert listener. Additionally, we conduct a statistical analysis of mutation with different representation setups. The overarching conclusion indicates that the system successfully produces quality variations post-mutation. While our case study focuses on Iranian classical music, the methodology can be adapted for Arabic or Turkish classical music.
